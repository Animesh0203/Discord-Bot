# Discord-Bot

This Discord bot allows users to play music from YouTube in a voice channel using the commands specified below. The bot is built using the Discord.py library and relies on youtube_dl and FFmpeg for handling audio streaming.

    Note:
    Make sure to replace the placeholder token in client.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN') with the actual bot token.
    The bot assumes the existence of a voice channel named "General" for joining. Adjust channel names or IDs as needed.
